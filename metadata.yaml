description: 'Once upon a time there were two devoted sisters, Grace and Marion. The
  younger, Marion, is engaged to Alfred, whom the sisters have known since he was
  a boy. Alfred goes off to seek his fortune, but three years later, the sisters receive
  a letter saying he''ll return soon to claim his bride. The night Alfred is due to
  arrive, Marion runs away with a neighboring landowner with a bad reputation who
  has made no secret of his lust for the beauteous girl. Fast-forward six years: Alfred
  and Grace are married, but they''ve never stopped mourning Marion. She returns home
  on Grace''s birthday and reveals that she ran away because she knew that Grace secretly
  loved Alfred, and wanted to remove herself as an impediment to their union. But
  Marion isn''t ruined! Far from it! She has been living chastely for the past six
  years with her aunt. Her virtue has caused the landowner to mend his dissolute ways,
  and he becomes Marion''s suitor.'
